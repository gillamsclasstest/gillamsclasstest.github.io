Hello! This is the source code for a website that I coded for my 6th grade classroom. It also has the source code of cookie clicker, details below.

This is a copy of the publicly available source of the game cookie clicker by orteil.  

Here is the actual game:
http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/

Here is the orteil home page:
http://orteil.dashnet.org/


The purpose of this repository is to make a website for my classroom.

All rights for Cookie Clicker go to Orteil

I understand that in the main html of cookie clicker, it says "Feel free to alter this code to your liking, but please do not re-host it, do not profit from it and do not present it as your own." 

Orteil, if you are reading this and you want the page taken down, let me know and I will take it down A.S.A.P.
